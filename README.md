* This code implements a Raft consensus algorithm, a distributed consensus algorithm which is utilized for achieving fault tolerance and consistency in distributed systems. It ensures that a group of nodes agree on the state of the system, particularly managing replicated logs, to maintain data consistency and availability despite failures or network partitions.
